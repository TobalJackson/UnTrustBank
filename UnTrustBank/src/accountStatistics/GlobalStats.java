//	Number of accounts, sum of the balances of each type of account (as well as sum of credit limits for LOCs).  
	//If the sum is tracked, you should also be able to report the average (for obvious reasons), and it'd be nice to have standard deviation data, though I guess it's not strictly necessary here.
	//One last piece that'd be nice, but not required - the average utilization of LOC accounts - the % of the total credit limit currently used.
//
//	Also, obviously, the current "loan cap."
